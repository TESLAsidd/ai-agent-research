# Advanced Search Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Perplexity API Model Name Issue
**Problem**: The Perplexity API was returning a 400 error due to an invalid model name.
**Error Message**: `Invalid model 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online'`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the model name in [config.py](file://c:\Users\siddh\OneDrive\Desktop\agents\config.py) from `llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online` to `sonar-small-chat`
- This is a valid Perplexity model that should work with the current API

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem**: When Perplexity API failed, it was causing the entire advanced search to fail.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added proper error handling in [modules/enhanced_search.py](file://c:\Users\siddh\OneDrive\Desktop\agents\modules\enhanced_search.py):
  - Try-catch blocks around Perplexity API calls
  - Graceful degradation when Perplexity fails
  - Warning messages instead of fatal errors
  - Continue with other search engines even if Perplexity fails

### 3. Exa API Timeout Issues
**Problem**: Exa API was timing out and causing delays in search results.

**Fix Applied**:
- Reduced timeout from 15 seconds to 10 seconds in [modules/enhanced_search.py](file://c:\Users\siddh\OneDrive\Desktop\agents\modules\enhanced_search.py)
- Added specific timeout exception handling
- Return empty results instead of failing when Exa times out

### 4. Improved Robustness
**Problem**: The search system was not resilient to individual API failures.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced the [EnhancedSearchEngine.fast_search_and_analyze()](file://c:\Users\siddh\OneDrive\Desktop\agents\modules\enhanced_search.py#L346-L386) method to:
  - Continue working even when individual search engines fail
  - Log warnings instead of errors for non-critical failures
  - Provide fallback results from working engines

## Files Modified

1. **[config.py](file://c:\Users\siddh\OneDrive\Desktop\agents\config.py)**:
   - Updated `PERPLEXITY_MODEL` to a valid model name

2. **[modules/enhanced_search.py](file://c:\Users\siddh\OneDrive\Desktop\agents\modules\enhanced_search.py)**:
   - Enhanced error handling in `PerplexitySearchEngine`
   - Improved timeout handling in `ExaSearchEngine`
   - Added graceful degradation in `EnhancedSearchEngine`

## Testing Results

After implementing these fixes, the advanced search functionality is now working properly:

- ✅ Enhanced search engines initialize correctly
- ✅ Search results are returned even when individual APIs fail
- ✅ Perplexity failures don't break the entire search
- ✅ Exa timeouts don't cause delays
- ✅ Appropriate fallback to working search engines

## Usage Instructions

To use the advanced search functionality:

1. **In the App**:
   - Select "Enhanced" search mode in the sidebar
   - Choose "Advanced Search" speed setting
   - The app will now provide comprehensive results from multiple engines

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Search results from Tavily, Exa, and other working engines
   - Perplexity summaries when the API is working correctly
   - Graceful handling of API failures without breaking the search

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Model Detection**: 
   - Implement a way to automatically detect valid Perplexity models
   - Periodically update model names based on API documentation

2. **Better Fallback Strategies**:
   - Implement more sophisticated ranking of search results
   - Add more fallback search engines

3. **Improved Error Reporting**:
   - Provide more detailed error messages to users
   - Add status indicators for individual search engines

## Verification

The fixes have been verified through multiple test scripts:
- `test_advanced_search.py` - Comprehensive search testing
- `test_perplexity.py` - Direct Perplexity API testing
- `final_advanced_search_test.py` - End-to-end workflow testing

All tests pass, confirming that the advanced search is now working correctly with proper error handling and graceful degradation.
